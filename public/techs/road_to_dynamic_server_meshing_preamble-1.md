### How does the computer compute? Electrons, Transitors, Logic Gates
Let us start from the very bottom and build our way up:

Electrons move through conduit material.

This allows us to represent different states:

* 1 when electrons are moving,
* 0 when electrons are not moving.

We can then use tiny transistors to control this flow of electrons.

A transistor acts like a switch. But instead of manually switching it by hand - like we would a normal button switch - a transistor can be automatically controlled, by another electron flow. This allows state/data to change automatically.

When putting multiple transistors together in specific configurations, they create logic gates. And putting multiple logic gates together, one can perform binary math, comparisons, etc.

If you are interested in how exactly this works, here is a great video with visual explanations: [youtube.com/watch?v=_Pqfjer8-O4 - Branch Education - How do Transistors Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pqfjer8-O4)
