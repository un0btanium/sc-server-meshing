### Quick Disclaimer before we start
Even though there was a great effort made to use official information and sources, be aware that some aspects of how these technologies work are deduced and therefore speculated. Whenever that was the case, I tried to make sure that it was noted as such, either in the slide title or in the text itself, so have a lookout for them. Therefore, the information presented here are my own understanding at this moment in time and are therefore subject to change. In the light of additional insights, the information in this presentation will be updated accordingly. Feel free to contribute with information that I may have missed.

Feel free to check out the sources that were used in creating this overview for yourself. I listed all of them at the end of this presentation.
