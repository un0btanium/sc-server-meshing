### Free roaming of entities
Without being tied to just one area anymore, game servers are now able to load any area of the game world and be assigned authority over the entities within those areas (and unload and unassigned of areas they leave behind). The game servers can follow their authorized players wherever they travel to. They load the area and will be assigned authority over it; if no other game server has been assigned authority already, that is.

In the example, the players of the green game server spread out in the level and their game server followed them. No authority handoffs to the red game server were performed.
