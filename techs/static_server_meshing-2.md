### Initial Situation
With the first versions of Object Container Streaming (OCS) for both client and server done, we are finally able to move onto the initial goal: Server Meshing. Even with the OCS software systems in place, it is not possible to increase the player count to thousand of players nor add tens of thousands of objects into the game world to make 100+ detailed solar systems a reality. A single game server alone is simply not powerful enough.

Since the software technology that is Server Meshing is very complex, it is to be expected that it will take a long time to develop. To provide players a first version sooner, CIG decided to release a simpler, intermediate version of it first: Static Server Meshing.

This should theoretically allow AI improvements, gameplay mechanics and more solar systems and locations as well as slightly higher player counts to be added to the game sooner, even before work on the final Dynamic Server Meshing implementation would be completed. We will talk more about the different versions shortly.
