### Summary
Client OCS now provides each client a partial view into the entire level on the server. The server has to lift the majority of the work by letting each client know which objects to load from its drive into memory so that the client CPU can start receiving the entity updates from the server and have entities stay in sync with the equivalent entity on the server. (Speculation: It is likely that the client itself decides when to unload objects from memory based on its available RAM capacity.) The server figures out when a client needs to load and receive state updates. Whenever that is the case, the server communicates that to the client. Therefore, Client OCS put some additional load onto the server, to allow for a significant computation reduction and performance on the client.

This technology allowed CIG to improve performance for players significantly, because the amount of entities that had to be computed on the client was drastically reduced, thus the computation time for each game tick reduced. That also left the CPU with more time to help render more frames. The addition of multi-threaded loading and unloading of entities also reduced a ton of freezes and stutters. Client OCS allowed more objects like planets and their locations to be added into the Stanton solar system level (and more solar systems in general) without putting more load onto the player client.
