# StarSim
### Overview
A simulation run on a separate server which abstractly simulates thousands of simple AI (Quanta) as well as incorporate player and NPC actions to generate economy data, probability data and missions. All of this data is saved into databases which are then accessed by the game servers to display prices and populate the universe with appropriate objects based on the current state of the economy in that region of space. Also introduces dynamic events and Virtual NPCs to make the game world feel more alive and connected.

Released in its first version in Alpha 3.17 with Quanta generating the prices of quantum fuel, hydrogen fuel and repair services. However, in prior versions it was already used to manage and spawn dynamic events.

At the end of 2023 many StarSim features are hold back until the relevant gameplay systems have been implemented that properly utilize the functionality.

StarSim was initially called Quantum (Economy Simulator).
