# Local, External & Personal Inventory
### Overview
The first versions of inventory and item management will consist of a personal inventory (what the players can carry directly on them), external inventory (e.g. a cargo box or backpack) and local inventory (ships and landing zones). The local inventory is going to be an intermediate version toward fully Physicalized Items and Inventories. Items will initally be stored on ships in these local inventories and accessible via UI. Through iteration, more and more items will be physicalized as "real" objects which take up space in the game world and the local inventories will be phased out. At the same time more physicalized inventories will be introduced that will allow players and NPCs to store these physicalized items directly inside physical inventories.

First version came onlinein Alpha 3.15.
