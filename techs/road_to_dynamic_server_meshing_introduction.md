# Road to Dynamic Server Meshing - Introduction
### What to expect from this presentation:
This presentation is trying to offer a centralized place about almost everything related to Dynamic Server Meshing.

We will go over the the major and minor technologies that create the functionality of Dynamic Server Meshing. For each tech feature, an overview slide summarizes the technical challenges and CIG's approach to enable the required functionality. For all of the major tech features, there have been additional slides provided which dive into more detail.

There are also some introductory topics which go over some of the basic concepts in hardware, software and video games, which try to convey a basic understanding of their inner workings and limitations. Of course, you can skip them and jump right in by reading about the Object Container tech. But I will always recommend checking the introductory topics out if you do have the time and interest.

### Visual Examples
Throughout this presentation, I tried to incorporate images to help visualize how these technologies work and what their purposes are.

So lets get started! The usual game level is three dimensional and therefore has three axis (x, y and z). We will leave out the z dimension and represent the level as a flat 2D area. We do this for simplicity reasons, but remember that all the presented technologies are actually operating in 3D. A first example of a level can be seen in the image below. It features two players (blue and red) inside the level.

On the following slides you find further explanations and visual representations of technical topics that will lay the foundation for all the subsequent technologies.

### Quick Disclaimer before we start
Even though there was a great effort made to use official information and sources, be aware that some aspects of how these technologies work are deduced and therefore speculated. Whenever that was the case, I tried to make sure that it was noted as such, either in the slide title or in the text itself, so have a lookout for them. Therefore, the information presented here are my own understanding at this moment in time and are therefore subject to change. In the light of additional insights, the information in this presentation will be updated accordingly. Feel free to contribute with information that I may have missed.

Feel free to check out the sources that were used in creating this overview for yourself. I listed all of them at the end of this presentation.
