### How does the computer compute? Electrons, Transitors, Logic Gates
Let us start from the very bottom and build our way up:

Electrons move through conduit material.

This allows us to represent different states:

* 1 when electrons are moving,
* 0 when electrons are not moving.

We can then use tiny transistors to control this flow of electrons.

A transistor acts like a switch. But instead of manually switching it by hand - like we would a normal button switch - a transistor can be automatically controlled, by another electron flow. This allows state/data to change automatically.

When putting multiple transistors together in specific configurations, they create logic gates. And putting multiple logic gates together, one can perform binary math, comparisons, etc.
