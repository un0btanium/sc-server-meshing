# Road to Dynamic Server Meshing - Introduction
### What to expect from this presentation:
This presentation is trying to offer a centralized place about almost everything related to Dynamic Server Meshing.

We will go over the the major and minor technologies that create the functionality of Dynamic Server Meshing. For each tech feature, an overview slide summarizes the technical challenges and CIG's approach to enable the required functionality. For all of the major tech features, there have been additional slides provided which dive into more detail.

There are also some introductory topics which go over some of the basic concepts in hardware, software and video games, which try to convey a basic understanding of their inner workings and limitations. Of course, you can skip them and jump right in by reading about the Object Container tech. But I will always recommend checking the introductory topics out if you do have the time and interest.
