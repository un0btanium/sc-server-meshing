### Free roaming of entities
As mentioned, the load will be continuously monitored to try to have a smooth player experience and an economically optimal amount of game servers used. The entities of an underutilised game servers may be moved to another underutilised game server, so that one of those game servers can be shutdown down. In our example, the players/entities of the green game server were moved to blue game server, then the green game server shutdown.
