# Service Fleet Manager
### Overview
For Server Meshing to come online, there needs to be a manager for all servers and services of a Shard. This is going to be the job of the Fleet Manager (part of Shard Manager?). It is going to start and stop services and servers, statically initially, later dynamically under Dynamic Server Meshing. It is already developed with that dynamic functionality in mind.

This is already implemented with having horizontally scalable servers and services in mind, which becomes more used under Dynamic Server Meshing.

__Note:__ This has nothing to do with ship fleets. This is about fleets of services/servers.
