### From Multiple Shards to Single Shard 4/4 - World Wide Shard
Once Single Regional Shards are possible, work can begin on improving the lag compensation techniques. Those reduce perceived effects of latency for the players when playing across regions where latencies of over 200ms are possible. But further R&D is required for this. If it is possible and enjoyable, then all players play in a Single Worldwide Shard.

__Speculated:__ CIG might start offering an optional 'Worldwide Region' that will run alongside the existing regions, so players can choose between the regional and the worldwide shard. And maybe some day, the tech becomes capable enough where only the world-wide shard remains and the regional ones are removed.
