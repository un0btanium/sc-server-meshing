# Layers/Layering
### Overview

The term "layering" has ben mentioned and proposed for high population shards/servers in the 2021 Server Meshing & PES Q&A to help prevent overloading the clients with too much data from too many players. Other possible workarounds were proposed (such as closing jumppoints or AI blockading) but nothing definitive decided yet. Since there was no defintion provided we can only speculate it's meaning:

__SPECULATED:__ For scenarios where in-game areas are extremely populated by creating layers of an area (or an entire shard), meaning that multiple instances of that area/shard exist in parallel within the same shard. Although, it is unclear if this is limited to an area or if the entire game world/shard will be instanced. This solution might take into account friend and foe to put relevant interacting players into the same layer, potentially moving players more or less seamlessly between layers if needed. This would mainly be done to keep the performance on the side of the player client in check. The server side should be fine.

__OR:__ Players of different shards can meet up by layering areas of the game world.
