# Layers/Layering
### Overview
__SPECULATED:__ For scenarios where in-game areas are extremely populated, the game might decide to reduce access for other players (like closing jumppoints or AI blockading) or by creating layers that area, meaning that multiple instances of that area exist in parallel within the same shard. Although, it is unclear if this is limited to an area or if the entire game world will be instanced. This solution might take into account friend and foe to put relevant interacting players into the same layer. This would mainly be done to keep the performance on the side of the player client in check. The server side should be fine.

__OTHER INTERPRETATION:__ This might refer to layering of servers and services instead, by which players exchange data with a server in the region of the player (for low latency) and that server exchanges data with a services geographically located in the middle of two regions to exchange data of servers across regions

__OR:__ Players of different shards can meet up by layering areas of the game world.
