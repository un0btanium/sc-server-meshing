### From Multiple Shards to Single Shard 1/4 - Static Server Meshing
Initially- under static server meshing - all shards will be statically meshed. That means multiple, small and equally sized shards. Each region will have its own shards.

Even tho the individual shards are statically meshed, the number of shards can still change. For example, a new shard is spun up whenever more players login and want to play and all other shards are already full.
