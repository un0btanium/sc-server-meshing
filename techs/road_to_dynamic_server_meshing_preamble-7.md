### Form of Data Storage
__Drive (HDD/SSD):__

Digital data can be persistently stored on drives. Data can be loaded from and saved to the drive. Data can be stored on mass, like terabytes of data on a single drive, since drives can be cheaply produced. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) have mechanical parts and are therefore slower when it comes to read and write speeds. Solid State Drives (SSDs) are not mechanical and therefore data can be directly read and written, resulting in much faster read and write speed performances, but consequently are more expensive.

__Random Access Memory (RAM):__

Another way to store data is in the Random Access Memory. This type of memory performs even faster than SSDs when it comes to read and write speeds, however makes it even more expensive which is why RAM is usually in the ranges of a few gigabytes (4-32GB), not terabytes like drives are. However, data in RAM is volatile, meaning that if power is cut, the data stored in the RAM is lost, making RAM a great (because fast) storage while the computer is running and processing data, but useless as a long term storage device once the computer is turned off.
