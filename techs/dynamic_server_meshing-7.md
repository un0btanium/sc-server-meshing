### Free roaming of entities
Under Dynamic Server Meshing, most of the core logic of Static Server Meshing will stay intact. It is merely iterated and improved upon to be able to achieve larger Shards with more players and entities in them, while also managing the real world economical side of renting just the necessary/optimal amount of game servers. This is done by scaling the number of game servers and other services (Replicants and Gateway services) to the optimal amount based on ingame load.

For simplicity reasons (and because I felt lazy :D), we have removed the red and green boxes in the image below. The functionalities of Entity Authority, Authority Transfers, Entity Zones and 'client views' between game servers still exist and continue to be utilized, even tho we dont show it here.
