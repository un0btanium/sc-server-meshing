### Free roaming of entities
When more players are joining the Shard, or there is more activity and load happening (like a big spacebattle), then more game servers can be spun up and connected to the Shard. The players and entities can then be re-distributed across the game servers for optimal load on each.

Likewise, in the case where a game server crashes, a new one can be spun up (or an existing server can take over for a short while), load the entities again and continue the simulation with only a minor disruption to gameplay.
