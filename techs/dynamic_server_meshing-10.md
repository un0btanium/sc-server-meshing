### Free roaming of entities
At this point, authority might be handed off anytime to one of the game servers. But it could also be decided that these players stay on their game servers, so it is also very possible that players stay on their assigned game server throughout their whole play session.

Maybe, most of the time, only interacting entities need to be moved onto the same game server (for example reduce server-to-server communication, the need for consensus techniques and ultimately to reduce computational load and save on game servers). For example, entities that travel past each other (like while flying, especially in Quantum Travel) do not need to be moved onto the same game server.
