### Computation and Communication
__Central Processing Unit (CPU):__

The CPU is responsible for the execution and monitoring of code instructions which allows the computer to be programmed by software for various purposes. The CPU transforms data from one state/form into another by making calculations and logic comparisons. While the CPU itself has a few MB of very fast memory (L1, L2 and L3 memory cache), the CPU still heavily utilizes the RAM to load and save data. The program that runs on the CPU determines which data is loaded from the drive into RAM (as well as saving data from the RAM onto the drive). This usually happens when the program is started, but data can also be loaded/streamed-in while it is running.

__Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):__

While the CPU is great at certain tasks like program execution, it usually is not great at rendering digital images fast. Another processing unit designed specifically for rendering graphics called the GPU allows for much faster and better results. It also has its own form of memory, the VRAM, to store textures and assets. The CPU usually tells the GPU via a rendering API what it should render.

__Mainboard:__

All these previous parts are connected with each other via the mainboard. All computer components communicate over connections, called the bus system (e.g. PCI and SATA). They basically are data highways from one component to another, the flow of data being controlled by the CPU.
