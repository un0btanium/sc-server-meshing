### Dynamic Server Meshing Version 2 1/2
What we saw in the previous slides is just the first version of Dynamic Server Meshing. Once this works well, it will be expanded upon, because there are some ingame scenarios that may not work well with this solution. Mainly if many player meet up in a single zone. Especially in mid- to large-sized zones.

For example, if a lot of players were to go (back) to the spacestation, then the red server is assigned only the space station zone. But if there are so many player that even that isnt enough, a single zone and thus server still gets overloaded

To solve that we will have to make room for another game server.
