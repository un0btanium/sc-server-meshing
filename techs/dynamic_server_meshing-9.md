### Free roaming of entities
When players from different game servers meet up in the same location and the game servers "overlap", then they will load all entities in that area and start exchanging 'client views' of their authorized entities with each other. The same way they did at the section overlaps under Static Server Meshing. This way both game servers can make hit detection and collision checks cross game servers without each having to simulate the entities of the other game server.
