### Shard Transitions vs Entity Authority & State Replication
There are going to be different types of transfers happening under Server Meshing. Lets have a quick look at each one:

* Entity Authority Transfers will only be used within a Shard to pass authority beween two game servers of that Shard. That means authority can never be passed to a game server of a different shard. Remember that each game world has its own contained state of the game world and its own game servers that simulate only that state. An Authority Transfer means that another game server is made responsible for simulating the entity. These authority transfers are happening infrequently and will be more frequent, once Shards are scaled with more game servers simulating different parts of a game world.
* (Player Item) Shard Transfers are transitions that happen across two shards. This can only happen while a player is not actively playing and will eventually be triggered by matchmaking when we are put into a different shard rather than the one we last played on (e.g. because we want to play with a friend on another shard). These Shard Transitions will become less and less frequent the larger shards are scaled, because players are more likely to keep playing in the same Shard across multiple play sessions. Ideally (!) we would have just one Shard, so that no Shard Transfers are necessary.
* There is also Entity State Replication, which could be seen as the transfer of entity state and actions. Here, entity state is send to different machines, such as player clients, the EntityGraph database and other game servers (more on this later). Like Entity Authority Transfers, the replication of state occurs only within the same shard. Sending this state is very frequent and can happen multiple times a second, sometimes on each game tick. Serialized Variables and OCS optimize this.
