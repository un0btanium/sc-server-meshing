# Single Shard
### Overview
Even if a first Dynamic Server Meshing has been released, there is still more work left to be done to have it scale up and make a single shard possible.

__Challenges:__

* the early versions of Server Meshing wont be powerful enough just yet to allow all players to play in. the same game world; we will continue to play in a multiverse, albeit less and less over time as shards grow in terms of how many players can support.

__Solution:__ Single Shard

__Goals:__

* have all players of a region or worldwide play in the same game world.
* gradually/iteratively improve and scale up Server Meshing until a single shard universe is possible .

__Approach:__

* scale up the amount of servers per Shards high enough so that all players can fit into a single shard.
* The first milestone/goal is going to be one shard per region (all players from US play on their own single shard, all players from EU play on their own single shard, etc).
* The final goal is offering a world-wide shard.
* This will require further R&D on how to reduce the impact of high cross-region latency.
* For scenarios where areas have extremely high population, a layering technique might be introduced that puts interacting players into their own layer (speculated: similar to instancing?).
* Speculated: There might be a time period where CIG will offer one shard per region as well as one world-wide shard. For the developers, this would provide a testbed for global shard tech, while offering the players a choice between an experimental experience in the global shard and a more stable one in the regional ones.
