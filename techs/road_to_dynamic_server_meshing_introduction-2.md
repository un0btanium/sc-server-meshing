### Visual Examples
Throughout this presentation, I tried to incorporate images to help visualize how these technologies work and what their purposes are.

So lets get started! The usual game level is three dimensional and therefore has three axis (x, y and z). We will leave out the z dimension and represent the level as a flat 2D area. We do this for simplicity reasons, but remember that all the presented technologies are actually operating in 3D. A first example of a level can be seen in the image below. It features two players (blue and red) inside the level.

On the following slides you find further explanations and visual representations of technical topics that will lay the foundation for all the subsequent technologies.
