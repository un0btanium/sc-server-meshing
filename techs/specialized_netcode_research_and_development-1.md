# Specialized Netcode Research and Development
### Overview
To push Shards toward a potential world-wide Single Shard, additional research and development has to be done to mitigate the effects of high latency between services and clients when they are communicated across continental regions. Lag has to be compensated via netcode techniques and smart (re)location of services, requiring additional changes to the service architecture of Server Meshing.
