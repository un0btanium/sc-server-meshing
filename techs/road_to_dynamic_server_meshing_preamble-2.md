### Clock Cycles & Clock Speed
Since electrons require time to flow through the logic gates, to give them enough time to do so, we introduce a CPU clock. And we only check the resulting state at certain time intervals, meaning after each clock cycle.

Depending on the clock speed, modern CPUs can have billions of clock cycles each second. For example a CPU with a clock speed of 4.0 GHz can perform 4.000.000.000 clock cycles per second! That makes each clock cycle last 0.25 nanosecond (that's 0.00000000025 seconds). Light in a vacuum merely travels 7 centimeters in that time span (~2,8 inches).
