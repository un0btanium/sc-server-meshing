### Conclusion
If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I hope that this presentation was able to provide a good overview and a new appreciation for these technologies. As we can see, a lot of work has already been completed and we are getting ever closer to Dynamic Server Meshing for Star Citizen being a reality. Even after the release of Dynamic Server Meshing, all these software systems we talked about will most likely be continuously maintained, iterated over and optimized over many years to keep improving on the player experience and allow for larger Shards.

While this is the end of the major tech explanations, there is still much more information about each of the minor and related technologies left to check out. Feel free to keep on reading! And let me know if you found this overview helpful :)

Also don't forget to check out the sources at the end of the presentation with all the information for yourself!

And a big thanks goes to the developers at CIG for working on these software systems to make Star Citizen a reality!
